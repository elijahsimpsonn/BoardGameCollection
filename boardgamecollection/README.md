# Board Game Collection Page
This web app uses the BGG API to display a list of games you own in our collection, and allows viewers to filter the list by player size and average play time
I built this application for my friends, and while it's not fully where I want it to be, I think it is done enough to consider an MVP

If you want to use the application yourself, search for you games on [Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/) and modify the values in the array in the gameids.tsx file to match the game ids of the games you own.
