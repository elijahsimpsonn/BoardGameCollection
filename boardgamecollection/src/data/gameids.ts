// This array contains the IDs of the board games in your collection. The IDs are used to fetch the data for each game from the BoardGameGeek API. You can find the ID by searching the game on BoardGameGeek and looking at the URL. For example, the ID for "Catan" is 13, so you would add 13 to the array if you wanted to include that game in your collection.
